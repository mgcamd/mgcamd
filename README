====

This is the SoftCAM code modified to communicate directly with the Seca 
decryption algorithm. This avoids the need for a smart-card. It also works
with Irdeto and Viaccess and Nagra.

To run it as a stand-alone program, tune into the required channel and then
type
	mgcam
If you want to incorporate it into 'vdr' (or any other program), you must patch
the program so that it calls the ca_stop() method before it tunes into a
channel, and then after tuning to the channel it must start a new thread which
will run the ca_process() method. A suitable patch for 'vdr' is supplied.

This works with the 0.9.4 version of the Convergence driver. For earlier
versions (0.9.3), you need to remove the line that says "#define DO_XOR".

Convergence have fixed their most recent CVS version so that this doesn't
work any more. I'm going to stick with 0.9.4.

A key file names SoftCam.Key is needed, in the same format as that used by
Multidec version 8.

Use the letter V to mark Viaccess keys in this file. Note that Viaccess channel
IDs are 3 bytes.

For Nagra, use N to mark the keys. I've tested with Polsat on Hotbird (for
which the provider id is 7001). The verify key may be added to the key file
as key 80.

Patching VDR (tested with version 1.0.2).

These instructions assume that the MGCAM sources have been unpacked into
/home/mgcam, and that we are building VDR in some other directory (currently 
empty except for the VDR tarball).

1. Untar the VDR sources:
        tar -xvzf vdr-1.0.2.tgz

2. Apply the patch (must be done from the same directory as the one where you
did step 1):
        patch -b -p1 < /home/mgcam/vdr-1.0.2.patch

3. Copy the MGCAM sources into the subdirectory where they live:
        cd vdr-1.0.2/libmgcam
	cp /home/mgcam/*.cpp .
        cp /home/mgcam/*.c .
        cp /home/mgcam/*.h .

4. Back to the previous directory, and make VDR:
        cd ..
        make

Different firmware versions:

The control word must be xor-ed with a magic number before being given to the
firmware; Convergence have taken to changing the magic xor number with 
different versions of the firmware, in a lame attempt to stop this program
from working. The xor number can be specified in the key file with a line
like this:

X 0 0 1234567812345678

(the provider ID and Key ID should be 0).

Suitable xor numbers for various firmware versions are:

Version 0.9.3
X 0 0 0000000000000000

Version 0.9.4 and later CVS versions up to 2nd April
X 0 0 5555AAAA9999BBBB

CVS versions after 2nd April
X 0 0 A7349473C84EF35D

If you don't supply an xor value then 5555AAAA9999BBBB (the value for 0.9.4)
is used, simply because this is the firmware version that I happen to use.

Frequently (?) asked questions:

Q. Is this legal?
A. Probably not. At the least, it will upset the television companies. Being
sued would be a nuisance, even if you won your case.

Q. Is this moral?
A. No. Neither (in my opinion) is it moral for companies like Irdeto and
Seca to charge television companies for their encryption systems, when they
are so clearly incompetent and incapable of making a secure system.

Q. Can I redistribute this code?
A. That's up to you. How could I stop you without identifying myself?

Q. Is this code issued under the GPL?
A. The whole point of this code is to commit criminal acts, and you want to 
know about its copyright?

Q. Will this work with the Technotrend firmware?
A. I don't think so. It requires the CA_SET_DESCR ioctl to be supported by the
firmware. This was added by Convergence. I can only speculate as to why they
did this.

Q. Is this a major step forward in breaking the various encryption systems?
A. No. It uses no knowledge about decryption that has not already been 
made public. It just saves you having to buy a CAM; nothing more.

Q. Can this be made to work with Conax, Videoguard etc?
A. Not unless the decryption algorithm is already public.

Q. Could the television companies change their encryption to defeat this?
A. Yes, they could change the encryption system entirely. This is just a 
matter of issuing new smart-cards to all the genuine subscribers. Then there 
is a delay of a few weeks/months/years until someone cracks the new system.

Q. Can I help?
A. If anyone wants to help, I would appreciate any assistance adding any other
new algorithms (Irdeto II, Conax, Cryptoworks, Videoguard etc etc).

Q. What was wrong with Nagra in the previous version?
A. Nothing, but I has the wrong verify key and various other problems that
made me think it was not working.

Acknowlegments:
Thanks are due to:

Rupert Murdoch, for funding the cracking of his rivals' systems.

Whoever at Convergence made the security hole that made this possible.

The author of the Multidec SoftCam DLL, who discovered this technique,
and whose work I have shamelessly plagiarized here. He is the real star.

The authors of the Seca, Viacess and Nagra code which I've used.

Everyone who tested my code and pointed out my numerous stupid mistakes.
Let me know if you would like you name listed here: otherwise I'll keep
you anonymous.
